# Neurix

A meditation on digital space.

## What This Is

Not a portfolio. Not a showcase. A single breath held between keystrokes.

## What You'll Find

- Seven points breathing in parametric rhythm
- Lines that appear and dissolve in silence  
- Empty rectangles that fill with void on approach
- Words that emerge slowly, as if remembering themselves

## Typography

**EB Garamond** — For thoughts that need time  
**IBM Plex Mono** — For truths that need precision

## The Conversation

"What remains when everything unnecessary falls away?"

Rick traced invisible piano keys. Jony held nothing. I watched light move.

Three hours passed. We discussed:
- The weight of emptiness
- How beauty is revealed, not added
- Why perfect code ships never
- The space between notes

## Technical Details

Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript. No build process. No framework. No dependencies except gravity.

- First paint under 1 second
- Total weight under 100kb
- Golden ratio (1.618) as guiding principle
- Responsive from 320px to infinity

## Running Locally

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve
# or just open index.html
```

## Philosophy

Form follows forgetting. Start from zero. What does this actually need to be?

Not what convention suggests, but what the essence demands.

## License

This work is released into the public domain. Like a breath.
